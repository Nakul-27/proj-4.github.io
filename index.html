Generative AI: I used Generative AI in this assignment to aid me in some of the minutiae of working with observable.
A specific example is that I was trying to figure out how to have the coloro on the map correspond to the export_level (top, second, third) of that specific port.
I realized that I needed to map from the portId to the color - which spanned across dictionaries. Generative AI had helped me draft a function to do this, which allowed me to focus on visualizing the map more.
Another case I used it for was helping me pick colors. I gave it the categories of industry that I had and had it generate some baseline hexadecimal values that would fit those colors. I tweaked on my own from here, but this was good in seeing what some preliminary colors were.

        <h1>On the Move - An Analysis of Shipping Ports Around the World</h1>  
        When looking at networks, there are few that rival the impactfulness of the global shipping supply chain.
        According to the International Chamber of Shipping, in 2019, the total value of the annual world shipping trade had reaeched over $14 trillion.
        Given how dense this topic is, this analysis focuses on ports around the world, specifically as they pertain to industries and connectivity. 
        <br>
        There were two datasets used for this analysis.
        <ol>
            <li> <a href="https://portwatch.imf.org/datasets/acc668d199d1472abaaf2467133d4ca4/about">Port Data</a> on 1388 ports provided by the IMF Portwatch in partnership with Oxford University.</li>
            <li><a href="https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/cli029-Global-Container-Port-Network?section=Discover&selectedCollection=&zoom=3&lat=0&lng=0&pitch=0&bearing=0&basemap=dark&labels=light&layers=%255B%257B%2522dataset%2522%253A%2522c17296d6-8629-4769-900b-81d7a7037b1e%2522%252C%2522opacity%2522%253A1%252C%2522layer%2522%253A%2522138bf4d9-f9b1-4632-a4e1-dc4a42f8783a%2522%257D%255D&aoi=&page=1&sort=most-viewed&sortDirection=-1">Connectivity of Container Ports</a> in 2017 for 536 Ports provided courtest of ResourceWatch.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Below there are two visualizations.
        <ol>
            <li>Bipartite Graph of Ports that share a top (or second/third most) exported industry. Note that the viewer can change between top, second, and third most exported industry via the menu below. This will chagne the bipartite graph and visualization (2).</li>
            <li>Wordwide Map of Port Connectivity by Degree for the Year 2017.</li>
        </ol>
        <b>The hypothesis for this analysis is that, while there are 1388 ports provided by Port Watch, there are a few behemoths that are responsible for most of the world's exporting of goods.</b>
        I would've liked to analyze shipping routes specifically, like what was done in this <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/25/11503152/shipping-routes-map">Vox article</a>, however; I found that this data relied on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system">AIS data</a>, which is not open source.
        That said, the below visualizations do provide some incredible insight into which industries dominate shipping and which areas - geologically - are crucial for shipping. This can have implications in all areas of life, from economic to political to military. 
        <br>
        <b>I hope you enjoy looking at these visualization and can glean some new insights into the world of global shipping. I truly enjoyed making them.</b>
